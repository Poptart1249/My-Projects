input from the user and would give feedback on the recommended brick count needed for their project.

## Project 2: TempStation Project
Description: This project was a solo assignment. My task was to create a program that resembled the COVID station in our building.
Our only mandatory feature was that it recognized the temperature of the person and would give feedback.
