# My Academic Projects
 Hello! My name is Jamison Williams. I am currently a senior at Fayetteville State University majoring in Computer Science. I started my journey in programming in 2020 where I began at FTCC where I began to learn to code. This repository contains some of my academic projects made over the past years.
Just a few of the programming languages I have grown proficient in and have coded projects in are:
- JAVA
- Python
- C++
